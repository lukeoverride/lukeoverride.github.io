                                            The big problem is to escape from a mad snowman who wants to kill you. You can defend yourself by shooting snow balls.
                                            But the weather changes and could be very foggy, so don’t waste your time!</br>

                                            Description: An Unical Experience is an Indie videogame developed in team by me and other two collegues.
                                            This was a project for “Graphical Interfaces and Event Programming” exam at University of Calabria.
                                            The location is right our university, in particular the Bucci’s Bridge.
                                            The game was only for didactic purposes. Some of the assets have been taken from open source repository with GNU license,
                                            some others have been created or animated with Blender.</br>
                                            Technical features: 3D graphics, artificial intelligence, network, java JMonkey engine.

                                        <p>
                                            Story: Waldo, The Asset Quest is a Third Person Shooter. The player is the sentient robot Waldo who travels around dimensions without any conceptual meaning.
                                            The game represents a great challenge, since there are no health collectables or tutorial. All of this makes the player in a confused state which evolves in the consciousness of his means and game mechanics.
                                            In addition, there are many dangers hanging over the player (traps, enemies, bullets, etc.).<br />

                                            This videogame is a gamification of the life of Claudia, an italian photographer who suffers from Small fiber peripheral neuropathy.
                                            In the first level Claudia is at the hospital, and has to escape from nurses.
                                            In the second level she is back at home, and needs to take medicines to be fine.
                                            The third level is her photo studio where she will process the film.
                                            In the last level, she goes for a trip in the outer space to not suffer from gravity forces.
                                            At the end of each level, she meets a Naiad, a water nymph who helps her get through it. The dialogues are in italian.

                                            Darwin is the last fish remained in the oceans. His friends and relatives disappeared because of Pietrolio, a bunch of garbage sent by humans.
                                            The story of the game is told from the point of view of the fish. The man is a unknown being.
                                            The two levels aim to entertain, but also to show what a poor fish and the environment experience because of us.
                                            The fishes cannot resolve the situation, we have to do something to help!<br />

                                This project is a proof of concept of a playable newspaper. The intent is to describe real life events through the lens of videogames. The videogames are optimized for desktop/laptop.
                                The games run on the web browser, so you can play some of them from a smartphone, but you may encounter a worst game experience. Please check the individual instructions on the page of each videogame.
