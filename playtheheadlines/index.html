		<h2>Giant ship is blocking the Suez Canal</h2>
		<h3>March 2021</h3>
		<div class="newspaper">
			Some days ago, one of the biggest container ships got stuck in one of the most important water channels of the world. The Ever Given caused a traffic jam in the Red Sea, since more than 230 ships are waiting to enter the Suez Canal, through which all navigation has been suspended. Specialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president has said he hopes the situation will be resolved within two to three days. In the meantime, as butterfly effect, the price of oil increased of 5%, reaching 60 dollars per barrel.

		<h2>EU starts Covid-19 mass vaccination</h2>
		<h3>January 2021</h3>
		<div class="newspaper">
		After EU's medicine regulator approved the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, the vaccination started throughout Europe. “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president wrote on Twitter. “The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries.”. Older Europeans and healthcare workers are in the priority queue of the campain to inoculate more than 450 million people across the European Union.
		The European Union’s member states made a show of solidarity by waiting for the bloc’s regulatory board to approve the vaccine before beginning coordinated national campaigns. But how those will play out in individual countries is likely to be disparate.

		  <h2>Erasmus in the time of Coronavirus</h2>
		  <h3>April 2021</h3>
			<p style="font-family: PoynterText">
			As students head back to universities this September, a new cycle of Erasmus+ exchanges is starting, but the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way the EU‘s student mobility programmes will be delivered. European (and non-European) university students will still study at foreign universities, but the crucial mobility aspect is in danger. Students can enrol as usual, but some universities are not inviting them to come to their campuses and only providing online classes. Others are offering full or blended mobility, which will see students learning remotely, with a chance to go abroad if and when circumstances allow. “This is a first time in the Erasmus+ programme,” said Kostis Giannidis, president of the Erasmus Student Network (ESN). “It’s a totally different experience.” In addition, fears surrounding COVID-19 and travelling mean fewer students want to participate in the programme. Sometime, the way to overcome the fear is given by students' associations, which are currently very active although the restrictions. Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is the biggest Erasmus association in Europe. It counts more than 13500 active members and operates following the principle: "Students helping students".

		  <h2>Researchers use ultrasounds to improve diagnosis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</h2>
		  <h3>January 2021</h3>
			<p style="font-family: PoynterText">A team of researchers at Guizhou Medical University (China) has revealed that ultrasounds can be helpful in the diagnosis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). High-resolution ultrasounds are a non invasive tool and shows the characteristics of peripheral nerve morphological changes in patients with DPN. They also investigated the application of shear wave elastography to further improve the efficiency of the diagnosis. Peripheral neuropathy symptoms might include: gradual onset of numbness; sharp, jabbing, or burning pain; extreme sensitivity to touch; lack of coordination; muscle weakness; heat intolerance. 
			There are many cases of DPN misdiagnosed patients for many years. According to Columbia University Medical Center, in more than 50% of cases, the cause can be addressed before the damage is more severe. Therefore, it is extremely important to have efficient and effective diagnosis techniques.
