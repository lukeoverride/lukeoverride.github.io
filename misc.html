							<h3>Music</h3>
                            <p>I like to spend my free time strumming guitar and harmonica.</br>
							Here, I play a cover of the beautiful song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oecX_1pqxk0">Mr. Tambourine Man</a>, in Italian.
							Original words and music are from Bob Dylan, the italian lyrics are from Tito Schipa Jr.
							In an interview with journalist Cameron Crowe included as notes for the 1984 box set Biograph,
							Dylan offered thoughts on the creation of the song:</br>
							<i><b>Mr. Tambourine Man</b>, I think, was inspired by Bruce Langhorne. Bruce was playing guitar
							with me on a bunch of the early records. On one session, Tom Wilson had asked him to play
							tambourine. He had this gigantic tambourine. It was like, really big. It was as big as a wagon wheel.
							He was playing, and this vision of him playing this tambourine just stuck in my mind.
							He was one of those characters. I don't know if I've ever told him that.</i>
							</p>

							<p>As you might have noticed from the cover, I am a fan of Bob Dylan. Some time ago, I made a presentation about him.
							The presentation spans Dylan's entire career, with a stronger focus on his early years.
							It includes some funny stories and anecdotes from relevant musicians that will give you the idea of his artistic genius.
							If you are curious to know more about him, feel free to watch it.
