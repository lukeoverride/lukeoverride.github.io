                                <p>There is a strong relation between cinema and mathematics (the camera view, the timeline, the fps, etc., etc.). Let's give some insights into the "recent" technology of 3D cinema.</p>
                                <p>If you look at an object near you and close your left and right eyes in turn, you will see that each has a slightly different view of the world. The closer the object you are watching is to you, the more different this view is. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy">stereoscopic vision</a> and it allows human visual system to perceive depth.</p>
                                <p>To create a similar effect, 3D films are captured using two lenses placed side by side, just like your eyes (or by producing computer generated images to replicate the same effect).</p>

                                <p>Athletics is strongly based on math and science, since the two most important things are the performance, expressed in time or meters, and the run distance, expressed in meters.</p>

                                <p>
                                    One could think about any other sport. I thought of it because of its "weird" score system, which can be associated to modular arithmetic.<br />Indeed, the score in tennis follows the following sequence: 15, 30, 40, "win".
                                    It seems that this system has originated from the presence of a clock in the playground, and a movement of a quarter of the clock-hand was done after every point. Thus, we are dealing with multiples of 15 until 60.<br />60 % 15 = 0    60 % 30 = 0    60 % 45 = 0<br />
                                    Apart from all, motion of the ball is described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion">projectile motion</a>.

                                <h1>To explain why music excites us</h1>
                                <p>Everybody has his own tastes and preferences about music, and almost everybody has ever felt some emotion, positive or negative, while listening to music. This can be related with two basic reasons: the notes and the rhythm. The latter is properly expressed in fractions (4/4, 6/8, etc.) and indicates the speed at which that song is being played.<br />The modern music is based on chords which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a> of notes on a particular scale and tonality. The distance between these notes inexorably defines the <em>mood</em> of the song. In particular, the intermediate note of the chord, defines whether it is major or minor. Our brain associates negative/malinconic emotion to minor chords and viceversa. And again, why? The reasons is partially due to cultural reasons, as well as innate factors. Well, probably it is based on our nature and the evolution.<br />Every natural vibration (as music is) is composed of harmonics, that are multiple vibrations of the main one. Basically, every fundamental note is sampled together with higher frequency notes, which defines the <em>tone</em> of a particular instrument. The sounds that generate us fear are associated with a large number of harmonics with unsorted frequencies (like heartquakes, lightning, explosions) and on the other hand, it appreciate sounds which are based on well structured harmonics. In addition, in the rudimentary communication decreasing sounds are expressed by suffering animals. So, our nervous system probably learnt to use groans to communicate pain, and groans usually have a falling tonality. On the contrary, happy and joyful phonations have increasing tonality. The same holds in singing. Hence, it is very likely that major and minor chords have opposite emotional effects because they recall the emotions associated with the not-verbal, spontaneous communication [<a href="https://www.scienzaeconoscenza.it/blog/neuroscienze-cervello/musica-emozioni">source</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics">further reading</a>].</p>

                            <h5>2 September 2018</h5>
                            <p>How many times have you watched a flower? How many a big wave? And how many years a small seed need to became a robust tree? And have you seen more sunsets or sunrises?  (Maybe you are not a morning person!)</p>
                            <p>One beautiful aspect of computer science is that software can model and (almost) simulate a lot of natural phenomena. In this post I would like to focus our attention on the development process of plants.</p>
                            <p>Considering an algorithmic approach [1], plants can be considered as a modular system consisting of basic elements such as leaves, internodes, and so on. Then, a plant geometry is the result of the interaction of the modules.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">Plant modules [2]</p>
                            <p>The formalism which perfectly matches this method of modeling structures are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lyndenmayer Grammars</a>. A grammar is a formal language which we use every day to communicate. For instance, the english language can be formalized as follows. A sentence (S) is composed of a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). A noun phrase may be composed of a determiner (D/DET) and a noun (N). A noun phrase may also be composed of an adjective (ADJ) and a noun (N). A verb phrase may be composed of a verb (V) and a noun (N) or noun phrase (NP).</p>

                            <p>An L-system consists of an <a title="Alphabet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">alphabet</a> of symbols that can be used to make <a title="String (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a>, a collection of <a title="Production (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science)">production rules</a> that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "<a title="Axiom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axiom</a>" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. It allows to model a development on the level of individual plant components (stem segments elongate, buds initiate new lateral branches, leaves unfold, and so forth). Specifically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Productions are used to capture each developmental event stating how a<br />component or module is replaced by a subsequent form.</li>
                                <li>String notation is employed to represent modules and productions</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>At this point, you may be wondering about the visual aspect of simulation. Well, no worries, computer graphics is helping us. Rendering systems and graphics engines could manage to get a visualization really close to reality, such as in <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/135/asset/vegetation2016_v9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Zootopia</a>.

                            <h3>A never-ending sunset flying towards west</h3>
                            <h5>19 August 2018</h5>
                            <p>
                                Some time ago I took a plane from Milan to Toulouse. It was delayed 2 hours because of air-traffic control strikes in France. So I travelled in the evening.
                                When we travel by plane, it is easy to imagine that we are travelling in space-time.
                                Indeed, if our route is perpendicular with respect to earth axis, that is, we are following the direction of some parallel, we are actually increasing or decreasing the duration of the day.
                                In my case, I was travelling towards west, at the time of sunset, practically my plane was following the sun. So, I had the lucky to enjoy a very long sunset.
