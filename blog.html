                            <h3>Technology, Science and Art in the simulation of natural phenomena</h3>
                            <p>How many times have you watched a flower? How many a big wave? And how many years a small seed need to became a robust tree? And have you seen more sunsets or sunrises?  (Maybe you are not a morning person!)</p>
                            <p>One beautiful aspect of computer science is that software can model and (almost) simulate a lot of natural phenomena. In this post I would like to focus our attention on the development process of plants.</p>
                            <p>Considering an algorithmic approach [1], plants can be considered as a modular system consisting of basic elements such as leaves, internodes, and so on. Then, a plant geometry is the result of the interaction of the modules.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">Plant modules [2]</p>
                            <p>The formalism which perfectly matches this method of modeling structures are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lyndenmayer Grammars</a>. A grammar is a formal language which we use every day to communicate. For instance, the english language can be formalized as follows. A sentence (S) is composed of a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). A noun phrase may be composed of a determiner (D/DET) and a noun (N). A noun phrase may also be composed of an adjective (ADJ) and a noun (N). A verb phrase may be composed of a verb (V) and a noun (N) or noun phrase (NP).</p>

                            <p>An L-system consists of an <a title="Alphabet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">alphabet</a> of symbols that can be used to make <a title="String (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a>, a collection of <a title="Production (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science)">production rules</a> that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "<a title="Axiom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axiom</a>" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. It allows to model a development on the level of individual plant components (stem segments elongate, buds initiate new lateral branches, leaves unfold, and so forth). Specifically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Productions are used to capture each developmental event stating how a<br />component or module is replaced by a subsequent form.</li>
                                <li>String notation is employed to represent modules and productions</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">The production rule: A -&gt; F[+A][-A]FA</p>
                            <p>At this point, you may be wondering about the visual aspect of simulation. Well, no worries, computer graphics is helping us. Rendering systems and graphics engines could manage to get a visualization really close to reality, such as in <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/135/asset/vegetation2016_v9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Zootopia</a>. You can also get a look at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2927332">this</a> work presented at SIGGRAPH 2016.</p>
                            <p>Other rooms for the simulation are represented by integration of biomechanics, animation, interaction between several plants, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=237279">space constraints</a>, influence of light and wind.</p>

                            <h3>A never-ending sunset flying towards west</h3>
                            <p>
                                Some time ago I took a plane from Milan to Toulouse. It was delayed 2 hours because of air-traffic control strikes in France. So I travelled in the evening.
                                When we travel by plane, it is easy to imagine that we are travelling in space-time. 
                                Indeed, if our route is perpendicular with respect to earth axis, that is, we are following the direction of some parallel, we are actually increasing or decreasing the duration of the day.
                                In my case, I was travelling towards west, at the time of sunset, practically my plane was following the sun. So, I had the lucky to enjoy a very long sunset.
